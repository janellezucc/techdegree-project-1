            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>Iâ€™m an English Teacher who is currently delving into the world of web development. I am working toward switching career paths and becoming a front-end developer.</p>
            <p>I am originally from New Jersey but I grew up in Orlando. I recently bought a house near downtown Orlando and I hope to work hard and eventually land a job in the downtown Orlando area. My plan is to make websites that are simple, beautiful, and user friendly. </p>
